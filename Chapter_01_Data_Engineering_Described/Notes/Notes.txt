Data Engineering Defined

Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and
produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning.
Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and
software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source
systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.


Data Maturity

Data maturity is the progression toward higher data utilization, capabilities, and integration across the organization,
but data maturity does not simply depend on the age or revenue of a company. An early-stage startup can have greater
data maturity than a 100-year-old company with annual revenues in the billions. What matters is the way data is
leveraged as a competitive advantage.
