Data Engineering Defined

Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and
produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning.
Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and
software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source
systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.
